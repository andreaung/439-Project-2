Project #2 required that we create a program that simulates a Turing Machine which then displays the generational progress of Wolfram's Rule-150 Cellular Automaton. 
We closely followed some online tutorials for creating the Cella rule 150 program. We created a eca() function inorder to go through the grid and 
check three cells (previous, current, next) at a time if they match any of the rules. At the end of the function the gathered information is than displayed.
We have a total of one javascript file (draw-stuff.js), one css file (styles.css), and one html file (js-1.html).

Running the Project file
1. We have submitted a zip file of our project and inorder to run it you want to first unzip the folder.
2. The folder contains a total of three files and two sub-folders. The two files are the complexity order.pdf and README.txt.
   One of the sub-folders is named assets and it contains the draw-stuff.js and styles.css files. The second sub-folder is 
   named view and it contains the js-1.html file.
3. Inorder for our project to correctly run the js-1.html file must be in a separate subfolder.
4. And to run the project you can click the js-1 html file to be redirected to a browser. (For running our project we used 
   Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.)

Setbacks:
We were not able to get our Turing Machine correctly running but we did include our progress of our TM in our project code.
