Project #2 required that we create a program that simulates a Turing Machine which then displays the generational progress of Wolfram's Rule-150 Cellular Automaton. 
We got assistance and used some portions of the code from https://jsfiddle.net/seeker5084/pu9b4u01/ by Hideyuki Tabata for helping create the Cella rule 150 program. 
We created a Rule150() function inorder to go through the grid and check three cells (previous, current, next) at a time if they match any of the rules. 
At the end of the function the gathered information is than displayed. We also created a TM() function to display the tape head but it does not work correctly.
We have a total of one javascript file (draw-stuff.js), one css file (styles.css), and one html file (js-1.html).

Running the Project file
1. We have submitted a zip file of our project and inorder to run it you want to first unzip the folder.
2. The folder contains a total of three files and two sub-folders. The two files are the complexity order.pdf and README.txt.
   One of the sub-folders is named assets and it contains the draw-stuff.js and styles.css files. The second sub-folder is 
   named view and it contains the js-1.html file.
3. Inorder for our project to correctly run the js-1.html file must be in a separate subfolder.
4. And to run the project you can click the js-1 html file to be redirected to a browser. (For running our project we used 
   Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer.)
5. Once the browser opens you two grids and two buttons will appear on the screen. The first button is the Rule150 button to 
   display the cellular automaton. The second button TM is suppose to show the tape Head but we were not able to get properly working.

Setbacks:
We were not able to get our Turing Machine correctly running but we did include our progress of our TM in our project code.
